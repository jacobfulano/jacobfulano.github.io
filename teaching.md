## Teaching

* [NeuroMatch Academy (NMA)](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a 3-week online school for computational neuroscience July 2020
  * I TA'ed this intensive, zoom-based course in Spanish. My "pod" consisted of 8 fantastic students from Mexico, Argentina, Columbia and Peru, and we spent close to 8+ hours a day working through code-based exercises. The materials from the course can be found [here](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/). Fue un privilegio!

* [Python for Neuroscientists](https://neuropython.com/), Columbia University [Spring 2020] (post-covid)
  * While New York City was still reeling from the terrible first wave of the Covid crisis in April 2020, a few of us from the Behnia lab decided to organize a short python course for our neuroscience colleagues. While our video lectures are not publicly available, the course slides and links can be found at [https://neuropython.com/](https://neuropython.com/)
