## Teaching

* [NeuroMatch Academy (NMA)](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a 3-week online school for computational neuroscience [July 2020]
  * I TA'ed this intensive, zoom-based course in Spanish. My "pod" consisted of 8 fantastic students from Mexico, Argentina, Columbia and Peru, and we spent close to 8+ hours a day working through code-based exercises. The materials from the course can be found [here](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/). Fue un privilegio!

* [Python for Neuroscientists](https://neuropython.com/), NBHV7050GR Columbia University [Spring 2020]
  * While New York City was still reeling from the terrible first wave of the Covid crisis in April 2020, a few of us from the Behnia lab decided to organize a short python course for our neuroscience colleagues. While our video lectures are not publicly available, the course slides and links can be found at [https://neuropython.com/](https://neuropython.com/)

* **Computation and the Brain** COMS6998, Columbia University [Fall 2018, Fall 2019]
  * In this discussion-based seminar led by Professor [Christos Papadimitriou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicomix), we discussed recent research papers relating to neuroscience and machine learning. I was lucky to be a TA two years in a row.

* [Introduction to Computational Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/courses) G4360, Columbia University [Spring 2018]

* **Introduction to Quantum Computing** CS 4281 [Fall 2015]
