## Research

I am currently working with [Larry Abbott](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/larry-f-abbott-phd) and [Rudy Behnia](http://behnialab.neuroscience.columbia.edu/) on models of *Drosophila* motion vision. I am also working on biologically plausible learning in RNNs for motor control with [James Murray](https://murraylab.uoregon.edu/).
