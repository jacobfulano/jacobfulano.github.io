## Research

I am currently working with [Larry Abbott](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/larry-f-abbott-phd) and [Rudy Behnia](http://behnialab.neuroscience.columbia.edu/) on models of *Drosophila* motion vision. I am also working on biologically plausible learning in RNNs for motor control with [James Murray](https://murraylab.uoregon.edu/).

## Master's Thesis

1. ["Decoherence, Superconducting Qubits, and the Possibility of Scalable Quantum Computing"](/files/decoherence-superconducting-qubitsWEBv2.pdf) supervised by Allan Blaer in the Columbia Physics department and with the kind encouragement of Anargyros Papageorgiou in the CS department
  * **Abstract** Is it possible to implement a fully controllable, unambiguously quantum computer? While most in the field believe that the answer is in the affirmative, uncertainty and skepticism still exist among academics and industry professionals. In particular, decoherence is often spoken of as an insurmountable challenge. This thesis argues that there are no fundamental mathematical or physical properties that would preclude the possibility of implementing a fully controllable quantum computer using superconducting qubits. The proof is in key results from the past 30 years in math, physics and computer science; this thesis is a sketch of these results. It begins with the well known theoretical results that have motivated the field - namely quantum algorithmic speed up and efficient error correction - and continues with an overview of the well developed theory of decoherence, arguing that decoherence has been and can still be significantly reduced. These theoretical results are related to superconducting qubits throughout. The thesis concludes with a summary of recent experimental progress with superconducting qubit circuits.
