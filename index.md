## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

I am a computational neuroscientist interested in developing experimentally motivated, mathematically grounded theories of neural systems. I am currently a PhD student in the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University.


## Research Interests

I am currently working with [Larry Abbott](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/larry-f-abbott-phd) and [Rudy Behnia](http://behnialab.neuroscience.columbia.edu/) on models of *Drosophila* motion vision. I am also working on biologically plausible learning in RNNs for motor control with [James Murray](https://murraylab.uoregon.edu/).
